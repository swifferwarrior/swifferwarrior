I'm undergoing a self-directed study to learn full stack with the end goal of moving from my current field of mental health to programming full time. I've previously learned Java through University of Helsinki's Java MOOC parts 1 and 2. I've completed basic front end development with vanilla JS, HTML5, and CSS3 supplemented with SASS/SCSS and have started to work on Ruby. However, I've taken a break from Ruby to learn about SQL and NoSQL databases in preparation for a private project that I've been collaborating on since July. It is in it's early planning stages but will implement non-relational databases (MongoDB in particular), Node.JS, and Typescript, all of which are being learned through FullStackOpen. I'm supplementing this knowledge with the SQL database material on The Odin Project for contrast and comparison.
